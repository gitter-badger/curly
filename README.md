###A cloud microservice based application


Curly is a *concept* of an application where you can upload, detail, favorite, and rate libraries and frameworks for all programming languages.

Collect it into your account and also show yours stuff to the rest of world

##What you can do
* Search using a query to match exactly what you are looking for.
* Import your project data from GitHub so you can easily create yours here.
* Rate the projects, libraries, stuff you used, and give users feedback.
* Discuss about the project using Disqus API.
* Liked ? Fell in love ? Heart It! And see them on yours profile, privately.


####It's *being built* with Spring, Netflix OSS, Rails, Sails, written in Java, Scala, Groovy, Ruby, Javascript, Kotlin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Each service is responsible to manage some resource or part of it which can decouple easily

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use REST calls through services for sync operations, AMQP (RabbitMQ impl) for async, GitHub OAuth2 and in next months together with your own Authentication Server so we can make a "premium" feature to register paid tools or non open sourced projects. Also the search query is powered by Elasticsearch. We plan to integrate some analysis too!
